# Teaching and outreach

These are coding projects that are related to teaching, such as workshops,
or related to do some science outreach, in the hope that people might find them useful
and interesting enough to get into those topics.

## Teaching

- [TimeSeriesConcepts.jl](https://github.com/BioLogs/TimeSeriesConcepts.jl) is an effort to teach people about time series. What these are and how are they handled. These pages are meant to teach, along with code, about time series fundamentals. I also maintain the [Python version](https://github.com/BioLogs/TimeSeriesConcepts.py).
- A very simple and straightforward workshop, [these notebooks](https://github.com/edwinb-ai/deep-workshop) are meant to teach the bare essentials of Deep Learning with the MNIST dataset. Also written in Spanish, they should be enough to get you started on this fantastic topic of Machine Learning.

## Outreach
- Originally meant as full-stack workshop to Machine Learning, [intelicompu](https://github.com/edwinb-ai/intelicompu) is a repository in Spanish that collects several notebooks on how to implement classic algorithms such as a *linear classifier* and a *$k$-means* clustering algorithm. Unfortunately, it is far from finished but the fundamentals are there for anyone interested. The idea is to serve as a starting point for anyone interested in Machine Learning, and can also be used as outreach material.
