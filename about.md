# About me

My name is Edwin Bedolla and I'm currently doing a MSc in Applied Sciences.
My research focuses on the applications of Machine Learning to Soft Matter, a
branch within Physics that deals with auto-assembling matter such as sand, glasses,
colloids, and many others.

Specifically, my work is purely computational. I mainly study hard-sphere liquids
where I perform computer simulations to calculate physical variables, both dynamical and structural,
and use this data to create a Machine Learning pipeline to solve a given problem.

I also work on new implementations of Machine Learning algorithms using the very fast and
great Julia programming language.
