# About me

My name is Edwin Bedolla and I'm currently doing a MSc in Applied Sciences.
My research focuses on the applications of Machine Learning to Soft Matter, a
branch within Physics that deals with auto-assembling matter such as sand, glasses,
colloids, and many others.

Specifically, my work is purely computational. I perform computer simulations to
calculate physical variables and use this as data to create a Machine Learning
pipeline to solve a given problem.
